#Slater Archive Wordpress Theme

This is a simple theme for the Wordpress site for the Slater Archive at UC Davis. It's based on the ['BLANK' theme](https://digwp.com/2010/02/blank-wordpress-theme/) by Chris Coyer and Jeff Starr. 

##Dependencies
###Sass
This theme uses Sass to compile CSS files, so please never edit the CSS files directly. Always edit the .scss files in the sass directory.
###CodeKit
This theme also uses [CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit/) to automatically compile the Sass files and to provide continual browser refresh while developing locally. Simply drag your local copy of the theme folder into CodeKit, and the config.codekit file should handle the rest. For more information on how to work with a local Wordpress install and CodeKit, see [this article](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-use-codekit-20-for-local-wordpress-development--cms-19402).
